# Genetic-Algorithm-for-Portfolio-Optimization-in-Algorithmic-Trading-
This project implements an algorithmic trading strategy that leverages a genetic algorithm (GA) for portfolio optimization, with a focus on achieving superior risk-adjusted returns. The system was designed and tested across two distinct periods—historical (training: 2017–2022) and unseen future data (test: 2023)—to evaluate its generalizability.
